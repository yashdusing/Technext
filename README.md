# No More Fake News

## Introduction
This project is about  detection,prevention,consumption of fake news.So , our solution proposed consists of a platform where users can publish news, only after investing  a certain amount.
If news is detected as fake , then no amount is refunded.The transactions made during publishing phase and refund phase are all recorded on a  decentralized blockchain ledger.

## Why this ?
The current system offers no loss of any kind to publishers writing sensationalized (and often completely fake) news.
In order to fix fake news, we need to disincentivize news publishers from publishing fake news (making it unprofitable or a waste of time to write fake news) and incentivize people to do research and think critically when they read the news.

## The solution consists of following 2 major components :
1)Classifying the news as real or fake

2)Transaction using p2p blockchain model
